transcript = """Raky and dear. The illusion of control is God, you know? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That's, you know, one of the things you want to talk about tonight was like the Mel Robbins. Yes. Video. Very interesting video. Yeah. And like this illusion of control. Right. Yeah. So I just rewatched it before we got on this call. It's just so so interesting. It's it's you know, I think we've talked before about this idea like everybody has their own distinct journey through all this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. But there are some there there's so many things that are similar to each other. You know, like it's like cascading failure across lights is one of them. It looks different for everybody. But it seems to happen for most people, not everybody, but there's I'd say that's good way of putting it though the cascading failure of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And and it's like I think that it happens for everybody. It just looks differently. So some people it's like no, it's like a complete cascading failure where they're like out on the streets kind of thing. Yes. And they're, you know, or they're like going through like the full bankruptcy or almost for bankruptcy or whatever it is. And then some people are just having like an emotional breakdown. But it's still like this. Like it's like the old has to degrade. I guess is probably the easiest general term to be able to put it in is that the degradation of the old version of you has to start to move in some way. Like you have to have that essentially like some type of a pain point to push through into what's next. And it's more like getting the brain to not be comfortable with the old narrative of you. And start to search for something else like even through like a why is this happening to me? And I think one of my questions at this point as well is because what I was thinking about was I was going to say do you think how hard it hits you is related to how much you are aware and choose the process and don't choose it. But then I'm kind of like I thought that was a good question to ask and I'm kind of realizing now that actually we're all kind of like whether it's a conscious or unconscious thing. It's kind of like you choose to go that way because whatever the other stuff was is dying like I'm kind of like you're dying inside of it so that can't operate anymore. But because I was going to say like because I remember parts during my process that it was brutal. And I would say to an extent I did choose some of it, which I think helped give the illusion of helping to speed things up, which probably made things rougher in the short term. But as I was watching Mal's video, what I was present to is it's either you're kind of willing to go there now, like to be like I don't know what this is but like let's go. Or why do you kind of keep kicking and screaming, which just pushes this further, which then kind of just gives you more of an impact to move like you talked about this comfort, like the pain point, you know, and for me that's that's life. I'm not about like pleasure driven. I'm like all about avoidance of pain. But it's like when the pain gets bad enough, it's like then I'll go, then I'll move. Yeah, I think I think it's a good question. Not easy to answer really because I think it's mostly, you know, there's so many different way it's so many different levels to answer it on, right? Like you could say, you know, it's it's going to go the way that you've chosen it to go before you came into this life. You know, you can down that road and stuff like that. I, you know, I think that that's a valid answer to it. But there's no power in that answer for you. Right. You know, sort of being like a bit of a thing to the whole thing and like I don't have any control and all this kind of stuff, which without having the proper support around that. You could fall into victim with that. That's a dark place. Yeah, it can be. So you can't you can be like, oh, I'm just a victim to this. And I have to say and all that's kind of stuff. And you go down, you know, a bad rabbit hole that way. Or it could be, you know, the where you surrender. And you understand that this is the process that you go through. And this is your journey. And I'm going to allow it to happen. So that. Yeah. But I think you need coaching around the set, the second one more than anything else to help you because it's not easy. Not easy to do by yourself. And the way that I like to look at it is, you know, that the, you get the, you get the touch on the shoulder. And if you don't listen, the touch gets harder and harder and say you got to hit and the head with a hammer. Yeah. And I feel like in Mel's video, she's already had like the little bit of a nudge at some point. It's getting to be a little bit more of a push. Now, as I was looking at the video that her, her next video after that. And not 100% sure because in the right up, it said that it was her first anxiety attack in six years, but she made it sound like it happened six months ago. Or something like that, not now, but she posted the video now. And it was her saying that she had an anxiety attack and it's been like six years since she's had an anxiety attack. And I'm watching this and I'm like, yeah, not surprising after your last video. Right, because this is another one of those, those pieces like this old stuff is is kind of coming up and the more that you try and sort of push it down and go, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not actually looking at this. I'm not looking at this. This is the life that I've created. This is the life I'm going for and everything else. And I saw something weird with Jordan Peterson recently that I think will tie into this. At another point, like a standard, but it's what I call, or there were pieces there in people who are normally very good and appear to be critical thinkers, like they able to think on their own feet. And but it's like when when those things start to go. Or they don't they don't apply it in all areas. Then you have these other bits, which are like the tops on the shoulder or the no just that. Get worse. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you know, the fight with the ego, you know, the ego does not want to leave. I find that that causes a lot of anxiety problems. Yeah. And a lot of this is so much around the ego, starting to take a backseat than anything else, right. True self, true self coming up to run the show. And you get the same anxiety. And it's another one of those kind of. And to me, it was like a like a nod like yeah, this is this is this process that's actually going on because these are some of the things that I've seen over and over and over again with people. Yeah. And I noticed in both of her videos, there's like wow, you know what this is going on for me and this really sucks. And it's like she's sharing something that's very heartfelt. And then she flips and she said so these are the the five things that I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, deal with this, which you know, I mean, it's it's what she does for a living, right. Like she's doing it because she genuinely wants to help people and everything else is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But it's like this. It's almost like like I'm watching like I'm watching a football game, right. It's like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, yeah, I think of the post. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, it's so it's such a fascinating thing watching other people go through this. Cause you one, you know, it's on the other side to, you know, it's going to suck. I almost say it's like a myriad of emotions that that I kind of go through, right. It's like I, my heart goes out to them. I'm dying to like I watched that video. The first thing I wanted to do is like reach out to her and say, look, I would love to help you. This is the thing that you're going through. And you know, I would just want to help whatever I can do to help. Yeah. More than anything else. But everybody has to go through their, their process. And it was really beautiful that she actually chose to share how she's feeling. And I hope that she continues to document this, this process as she goes through it. And, you know, yeah. Also hope that it's easy. Because it sounds like her whole like everything was falling apart. Like in a lot of ways her, you know, she had a TV show that got that got canceled her book deal got rescinded. The public speaking that she was doing, making stupid amounts of money doing that's all gone because of COVID. Yeah. And it's like, wow, and now what do you do at 52 right like it's, it's, it's harder. I think we believe that it's harder if we get older, I put it that way. And you know, what do you know she's in this place like, okay, well, what do I do now? I worked my ass off to get here. And now here is gone. And she's moving right she's moving to a whole other place. Yeah, yeah. I'm also not surprised. It's right like it's not, you know, it's not like she made the big decision, but you know, obviously she made the decision with her family to move. But yeah, it's like it's all part and parcel of the same, the same thing that's renewal two of the things I wrote down a couple things that she said. She feels like she's in between two lives. Yeah, that struck me as well. Yeah. That's about right. Yeah, definitely in between two lives. And I think it's, you know, how do you anchor yourself in the new life? And I'm wondering if she's asking herself those questions like that instead of how do I keep as much of my old life as possible. Yes. Because she had on the surface at least, it looks like she had a pretty good, right? You know, like she worked really hard, got to the top of her game and everything else. You know, why wouldn't you want to take as much of that with you as possible? But it's the whole, the whole thing like the more that you want to hang on to it, the harder it can be because there's, you, people end up having a belief that you can't take it with you to this new place. Yes. And that's what you're going to. And in my, in my opinion, that is actually the ego underneath playing the games to not lose control more than anything else. Right. So, hey, you know, if you go there, it's going to suck because you're not going to be able to take any of this stuff and you're going to be broken, you're going to be, you know, living on the streets and everything else. And that's actually completely not, not true, but it's like that thing that's, that's, that's there part of that fear that's in that background. Yeah. So I think the more that she asks questions like, what can I do to anchor myself in this, this new life and be willing to let go of all the old as much as possible. And it reminds me of, so like that thing that it's unique, because I remember there was like points, even when we were chatting, I would say maybe made process or possibly on, I don't even know if you can call the backend, whatever we were of me going through stuff. I remember there were things in there that like you could point out because you could see them from where you were at almost like, like kind of like this doesn't have to suck this much. But from where I was, I was kind of like, I was like, if you, because it was like, it was like so, like, not helpful, you know, like it's, and I don't know how helpful the right word, but it's like, it didn't those pieces, or it's like trying to find anything to hold on to give like some resemblance of comfort. And it's just not there. And then there's also what I call like those pieces that other people can see it's like what you've gone through, you can see pieces in it. But there's also something in it that like I was present when watching hers was like, and you have to go down the rabbit hole in a way that's like congruent with who you are and where you're at, like whatever your principal pieces are. So it's like, yeah. I like the idea that it could be, it could be pleasant, you could just shift. I totally think it's possible. And I don't know how. That's the goal. Because for me, it was like, with a lot of the belief that I had, I was like, no, like it really does have to suck. So it did. And there was kind of like, you could have told me anything in the middle and I would have got it completely like, or just stood it like, but I still couldn't get myself there. Like, it's like, it's like when somebody, what was the way I heard it put like me. And just, wherever you are kind of like consciously able to experience, whatever your spectrum is, that's all you've got access to. You can understand like logically, all of the pieces, but it's kind of, this is also in a space where words become less meaningful. Yes. Like there's more, there's more. Like I would call us, like we have this theory of the more information and have the more knowledge you have. But I took a slightly different spin on that lately that actually knowledge comes from knowing. And actually like to know something, you need so much less information. Because it's almost like the, a lot of the information is about trying to make a pointer win an argument, like to back something up. But when you like know something, you don't have to do that because it's not a threatening thing. And even like as you're talking about, like bringing stuff with you, it kind of gets some sort of comfort now in knowing that. Let's just say, however many times the wheel wants to come off the bike or the bike wants to like blow up and turn it to some other type of vehicle. It doesn't actually matter what it is anymore. Like there's a, there's a something and you had spoken with this recently like, like going from finding people that make a difference to you to actually. Mastery like finding some level of mastery, which is like actually. And knowing in yourself that it's not external stuff anymore. So you might pick up little pieces here and there from different people. It's less and less important because it's not an out there thing anymore. It's not a search for more information from someone else. Yeah, yeah. And that's what I was finding with those podcasts that I was listening to also is like. I don't need more information. Yeah. I really don't. And it was like, wow, this is just interesting. I think it's a general piece. Yeah. Do not take it on like I need to do something with this information. Is really quite an interesting. A different way of looking at it, especially when it's something that comes across so powerful. Yeah. Yeah, which, which does make it. Very interesting. And how you were saying, you know, about the, the. Where you were on the journey and I'm telling you, you know, it can be easier. You know, it doesn't have to suck this way. It's, you know, that we've been brought up to believe that anything worth doing requires hard work. It requires hard work. And for a lot of people, hard work is about nose to the grindstone hammering it out, you know, emotional, whatever it is. Like it's got a sock and everything else. And it's, you know, hard work can look a lot of different ways. Essentially, or the work itself can look a lot of different ways. Right? Because to surrender is one of the hardest things to do. That requires a different type of effort. Yeah. And it's the only thing that you really need to do. And let that guide you to where it needs to guide you. Because it's not all you surrender and then it's snap and everything is done. It's like all these other questions start coming into your mind as, as you work on that, as you work on the process of surrendering to whatever the fuck is going on. And those questions are important questions. And continuing to work on the surrender piece. And it's the battle that ensues between the two sides of you. Yeah. And it's your choice and how you choose to wage that battle. You could make it a real battle. Or you could choose to do it where you fall in love with the other side. I would say that there's something for me in it that's kind of what like, what I call like that almost like that old romantic end of things of there's like. At what point is there the final push. And the final push, you know, for me would have traditionally been like it's like, oh, like the best. We gave everything and it just didn't work. And then you're kind of move on to the next, but it's seeing the. The form that that takes can be very, very different. Yeah. Yeah. And the, I mean, you know, also the idea that there's like this. We've, I've been talking about it in terms of like this ego and it's going away in this battle and this this change and everything else. And the thing that people that you get on this other side is there was no battle. We made up the fact that there is this one side against the other side. Right. The lie of separation like yeah, exactly. A lie of separation, the lie of duality in that case, right. Yeah. Yeah. You know, the ego is the bad side and, and, and you have to get rid of the ego and the bad and the this and the that and it's like. No, life would be no fun without an ego. It would be so uninteresting without you know, it really would. So the other thing that Mel had said in her video was how she feels disconnected. She feels disconnected from it. I believe she said like disconnected from from herself and disconnected from everybody and stuff like that. You know, partially because she's working remotely. But it was her what she was talking about and disconnected there was was very different to, to just that. It's like this, the separation of, you know, between the two lives type of disconnected. She's like in this limbo space. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like those, those are like the little indicators that I heard in the conversation is like, yeah, there's something going on here. This is just, you know, shitty 52nd birthday, you know, waking up feeling depressed and sorry for yourself kind of thing. This is like actually. A, a bigger thing that's going on there that. That. I'm just fascinated to see, you know, somebody in the public eye who's going through that who is somebody who shares at that level. Like willing to put it out there because she knows it can help other people like wow, this, this is going to be great. This is going to be a lot of good help for people for sure. She continues with the process. And I'll be sitting there with my popcorn. Is she going to, is she going to, is she going to, is she going to, oh no. Oh, you were so close. Well, I think that's the, the, the other base with it for me is just. I wasn't even the words. It was literally like the video started. And I could just like, I could just like, see it rise. Oh, yeah. And I was like, I was like. You know, almost wanted to cry. I was like, I was like, oh, man, this is going to really suck for a while. Yeah, you can. You can. We told you about her. It was just like it's still like. I don't know. I think where I'm out now, I just. I don't know if it's that I have a bigger sense of where people are at or just I trust. It more. So it's like whatever that initial piece is, it's like whether it's a pull towards a person or like a. Just get away from them. Just such a, such a privilege to get a kind of a sense of where people are asked. Oh, not that you think that one thing is what she's in. Like, I'm said,терies. Okay. I mean, it's going to be the very right to. It's like it's a very long word of that sense. Yeah. Yeah, that's very important. Yeah. In you know on this end, of where things are off. Yeah, picking everything apart. Really have to pick everything apart. So that's pretty good. Yeah. I don't know what else I've got to say I'm not for no. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I just. I hope it all goes well, you know, as easy as possible. And that she does share that share it. You know, that's basically. Yeah. Yeah, just just keep sharing. And like I said, right, the emotion that was there, I think, was like huge, huge, huge. I think the other weird analogies I use for it. Like when you're at that stage where in fear, you've been winning at the game that you're playing. It's like you've got this really big ladder going up against this building. And you're climbing and it's like the higher you go. The better you seem to be doing the most success you seem to be having. Yeah. But then there's like at some point. The building on fire. But you're still going. And then it's like whatever that was no just turn into a turn to this one point to see like. Do you want to actually acknowledge the building on fire? And you're still you're still walking like you're still going higher towards the building of the song fire. And then it's kind of seeing that it's like. Whatever that is to kind of slow down. Maybe this is no good idea. And then like where the hell was I going up this building anyway? And what is this building like what's the like just that weird thing of whatever the auto pilots. Being that look like we were winning at stuff. Then becomes also the vehicle that shows you. Like is this really what. And you think it's all about. So weird. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that. You know, in her case like. I think that. Like she's had a great life. You know, like. Not just the financial success, but like family success and everything else. Like that's kind of the picture that I got. Yeah. And then it's like a picture of the. Where it's not a. Her financial success. Didn't come at the cost of. All of those are the pieces of all of those other pieces. Yeah. The important pieces. And it's. It's like, you know, getting to a point where it's it's more like. The game just changed. And then it's more than anything else where the. The question that hits you. As you start the new game is is this all there is for me. And then that second thing of questioning like. What's what's like. Where am I going now? Like wow, I've got all this. Where am I going now? And it doesn't this. And then it's a little bit. The thing that's the most important thing that. The old thing doesn't feel like it works for me anymore. I guess that's mostly what it comes down to, right? The old thing, the old way the old me the old whatever. Isn't working. Doesn't feel right for me anymore. And you can't reverse engineer what's next, which is kind of. A lot of what's been sold. Like, you know, whatever the goal is you want to find people who've done us. And just reverse engineers. Yeah, is when you start going through this. There's no way to do that. No. No, there's no way to do that. No, no way to do that. No, you can you can take some of the things that other people have done. And do those things. And see how they work for you. But that's kind of it. So you fumble around enough to you find the pieces that work for you that keep, you know, you find a little bit here and a little bit here and you kind of piece everything together. And I think most of that comes. At. At a cost of. Time. And. And then you can get your intuition. And then you can get your intuition. And then you can get your intuition. Stress. And upsets. Because people aren't as tuned into their intuition. So the more the more connected you are to your in my belief is the more connected you can get to your intuition right off the bat. The easier it is to navigate through to find the right pieces. Yeah. And I get the other piece I kind of just wanted to acknowledge with it as well is. And so this is a bunch of things that. I don't know how else to put it like having sold to us like if you do this in your morning routine or when you have certain times that you find things difficult. Here's some things to do. So you got meditation. You got some sort of physical exercise or going and making time for doing something that you reenjoy. But what I was really present to with the video was watching my my my my robins was. It gets to a point where the three of those things. No longer do. Yes, or no longer give you access to whatever it was they give you access to. Yes, yeah, and I found that the things that she wrote. Yeah, and I found that the things that she wrote at the end like I'm going to do you know do this to this like the three or four or five things or whatever it was like none of that is going to take you where you need to go. I get it and that's like you know in the old the old version. Yes, sure those things are going to work. Yeah, sure those things are going to possibly keep you afloat right now, but they are not going to take you to that next spot. For sure, and I guess I just wanted to draw a line on the that to just be like. You know, if anyone comes across this type of comes across us in this in their process. Some of those pieces would be would have been really good for me to know. Like that all of the things that I had found to help keep me centered and help keep me grounded and help keep me. Whatever, they just stopped working. Yes, not in a periodic thing, it was just like literally. And from one day, peaceful and centered with all these things to. I couldn't find anything to get me peace for a center. At all, like nothing. Yeah, yeah, and then it's knowing what to do in that space. So, and I think that again, like the higher that the more you're connected to your intuition, the easier that is to figure out what that next. The thing is that you need in that moment. Yes. And you have to, I think at that point, you kind of have to go through like a learning period of. You know, what are all the different things? What are all the different possibilities or even, you know. Get into a point like I need something. What is the thing? What do I feel? Like I need to do right now? Not what what do I think I need to do? What what is my craving to do right now? And I really is just right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know, one of the things that I've found has been really helpful is this idea of learning the language of your body. So talk about that a little bit. Yeah, so. Our bodies are always speaking to us. Continuously speaking to us, telling us all these different things. And we ignore it. Most of the time. You know, even the cravings that that that we have sometimes it's actually like our body saying, no, I actually want that tub of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Sometimes though it's like the brain and the addiction system going, yeah, yeah, yeah, give us more of this kind of thing, right? But in terms of like our bodies are telling us like when we have anxiety, when we have emotional upset when there's tightness in a different part of the body. And it's all telling us something and it's spending the time to sit and be with whatever it is that's going on and ask, ask some questions. You know, what is it that you want? What is, you know, what is it? And the emotions that are that are sitting there. And you know, sometimes it's like, well, you know, all the anxiety because I'm worried about this and everything else. And you know, what I found a lot of times in those situations where there's like this emotional piece that's there and it's connected to something that is going on in your life. And not actually that thing that's going on in your life. It's we have this reaction that we equate to it's similar to this emotion that I've had before, which must be about this thing that's happening over here. And it's like, okay, well, strip off that piece. So what's just the emotion that I'm having? Okay, now strip off the fact that I'm equating something to that to that emotion. So what is the feeling that's underneath there, not the emotional feeling, but like the feeling like what is the body actually doing and start to learn from that perspective. And it's like, okay, what is that? And forget everything else that you've learned before and just deal with that because it's telling you something new that you haven't you haven't actually experienced before. Yeah, in many cases like as you're going through all of this, right. And I think that it is it's like one of the best things you can do is start to learn everybody's everybody's body is different. You can't I don't think you could it's possible to create like a chart to be able to give people like, oh, if your body is doing this, then it means this like it doesn't I think that's impossible because it's so unique to everybody. And it should be. Like, not a has to be away, but just as in. Like from the blink that you become human. You can never be the same as anybody else. So whatever it like that thing is it's like. I guess it's called like just honoring that and kind of in the book. Well, where I'm out now, I'm getting it just just like actually getting back and getting back connected to the magical that I'm actually the value in the difference in kind of a world that we've been trying to. Be the same. Yeah, yeah, where we've been homogenized so much. Everybody is the same and we're all. We're, you know, on different levels of, you know, like how we go through school, well, everybody's the same age. So you all need to be in this grade and you know, that kind of stuff. And it's all about, you know, moving our society together better and love about. And then we're all on the level of things to the spiritual aspect of well, we're all one. You know, we're all one and everything else, which is, which is, yeah, absolutely, but. Not to the sacrifice of understanding the specialness of our individuality. And how that individuality can connect to the whole. But I think we lose the idea of being the, the, the specialness, the gift of all of that individuality, having this experience here, right here, right now. That is of the utmost importance. And having an understanding and a feeling and that deeper idea of connection that's going on. But not focusing too much on that. But I know it, I know it's there. I don't need to continue to keep my focus there, right? Like let's just focus on on wow, like. I am such an individual that the things going on it that my body is doing right now is telling me something specific to my experience that nobody else is having this same thing, the same experience going on physically right now. Yeah. And I think that's, that's really important. And I think that's something that's, that's greatly overlooked. And the narrative of we're all one is getting pushed so much that we're losing sight of that, right? It's like a copy. This other thing over here, look at this, this, the shiny object over here. Right? You know, you don't want to look at the old shiny object. You don't want to look at the old shiny object, which is, you know, the government and what the government is doing to us. And you know, you're out of that narrative. Now, here's a new narrative of all one. So come over here and just be peace and love and this and that and everything else. And forget the dark. We don't want to be in the dark. We want to be all in the light. And it's like, yeah, I want to something to miss in it. You're missing a whole lot there. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that that's a big piece like understanding your individuality. I think because like as you're talking about that, what came up was just. Like. In the process where everything starts to be different, it can appear like chaos. So finding pieces that help give you. And it's like, calmness, or peace in the chaos is important. But then for me, it's like also seeing then it's like as you start to get a little bit more peace in it. That. And then the uniqueness is almost like. And finding the little bit of chaos in the piece. At the same time, like there's there's like. Like you need all ends of it. Like if you're. You know, you can go from whatever it was before that we were trying to be all bland. And the same. And then. Certainly you guess whatever the next thing is and then it becomes. All like love and life. And then it's whatever the blandness is in that. And it's it's like just trying to keep. Yeah. I guess just honor whatever those pieces are that make sense for you right now. And then they they they can seem the oddest of things. And yes, they can seem very very odd. And then they can seem very odd. And then they can seem very odd. Yeah. What's worth it? Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, it's. It's, you know, what you know how you just put that it reminds me of like when a woman's pregnant and it's like they have cravings for like the weirdest stuff sometimes. Some do some don't, whatever. But it's like you just got to honor those cravings. And then they're like you know they're connected to like wow I really really need this. And it's getting you know generally connected to your body getting connected to yourself at a level where I need this. And yeah, this is completely not in line with what I've got going on right now. Yeah. But I really need this. And you just got to go and do that. And then you just get to know that you're going to have that feeling that's there. And the more you want to, I like I've seen it happen so many times myself and other people. Where it's as soon as you start honoring that. Everything starts to shift. Yeah. It's huge, huge. It's like, oh, you're listening. Great. Here's a lot more. And then you got to deal with a lot more. Thanks."""
